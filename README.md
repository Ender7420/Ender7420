<b><i> Hi, </i></b>
<p>
  I'm Ender, a guy who like to code and to make system that solve problems. My main interest right now (late 2023) is to create programs that help me when it comes to security. Don't expect something great though.
  <br><br>
  My main interests are programming, music and learning. I like to understand how things work, and i sometimes go too far and lose my mind... 
  <br><br>
  The first programming language i learnt when i was 12 years old was C#. I still write in this language, but i also use Python for current and future projects.
  I'm also learning Go, HTML, CSS, Javascript (not started yet), and would like to know how to make Android apps.
  <br><br>
</p>
<p>
  Regarding private messages and collaborative work:
  <br>
  I don't accept <b><i> ANY </i></b> private message, even from people i know. I won't work on collaborative projects too.
