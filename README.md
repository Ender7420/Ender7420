ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ender7420, a guy who likes to code. My favourite language is C#, but i also know some Python and C++
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming, music and learning. I like to understand how things work and i sometimes go too far and lose my mind...
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python to get ready for future projects.
I'll maybe work on collaborative projects with people i know only. 
ðŸ“« I don't accept any Private message unless if we're working on a common project!
